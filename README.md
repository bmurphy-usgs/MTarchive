# MTarchive

NOTE: This is a work in progress.  

The goal is to develop a HDF5 standard for storing magnetotelluric (MT) time series data.

The code mth5 is the beta version of reading/writing an HDF5 file specifically for MT data.

This uses JSON encoding for most of the metadata.  See /docs for more documentation.  

Feel free to comment or send me a message at jpeacock@usgs.gov on the data format.
