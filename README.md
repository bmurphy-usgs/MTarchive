# MTarchive

The goal of MTarchive is to develop tools for archiving magnetotelluric (MT) time series data.  

The preferred format is HDF5 and has been adopted to conform to MT data.  The module mth5 contains reading/writing capabilities.  

Most of the metadata is encoded in JSON and follows the format proposed for storing transfer functions in XML.  See /docs for more documentation.  

Note: This is a work in progress.  Feel free to comment or send me a message at jpeacock@usgs.gov on the data format.
